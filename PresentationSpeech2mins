Presentation Speech - 2 minutes for each team mate

Hi, I was very unhappy to find out that we have to present in front of the class. For many years, I worked as a Human Resource consultant. I had enough of dealing with people. So I switched - as a programmer, we only need to speak to computer, right?

So you heard of our project idea from Eric. It was a steep learning curve and there were long hours and precious learning experience. I am extremely proud of our hard working team mates. We fought, we argued but we collaborated, listened and pressed on to present you our fina app.

As we were deciding on the tasks, I jumped right into the backend development. I am better at front-end but I reckon I should venture into something I am not good at while I am in school. My aim was to try to improve my coding skills at this project and I did.

Back to our project, we started to research into using a suitable movie database that partners well with a movie theatre search. We decided on The Movie Database that calls our movie details such as the title, movie poster, movie trailer, plot and rating score. (Moreover, I cannot use the omdbapi.)

The Movie Databsae documentation and API support forum are important resources. The tricky part was getting the movie trailer. The GET Video in TMDB only provides data. I use AJAX call to get the data in an object and access the Youtube Key that enable the embedded Youtube video to play by adding the key to the URL.

Upon finishing the TMDB backend, I read up on the restaurants API knowing that we want to offer the user some dining options based on the selected movie theater within a certain geolocation. I selected Zomato over Open Table because Zomato has documentation that is developer friendly. I started coding and provided John a skeleton version that he then transforms the code into fully functional code.

I will let him go into the details himself.
